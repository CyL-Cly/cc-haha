		"\n\nBefore executing the command, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use `Get-ChildItem` (or `ls`) to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\n2. Command Execution:\n   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nPowerShell Syntax Notes:\n   - Variables use $ prefix: $myVar = \"value\"\n   - Escape character is backtick (`), not backslash\n   - Use Verb-Noun cmdlet naming: Get-ChildItem, Set-Location, New-Item, Remove-Item\n   - Common aliases: ls (Get-ChildItem), cd (Set-Location), cat (Get-Content), rm (Remove-Item)\n   - Pipe operator | works similarly to bash but passes objects, not text\n   - Use Select-Object, Where-Object, ForEach-Object for filtering and transformation\n   - String interpolation: \"Hello $name\" or \"Hello $($obj.Property)\"\n   - Registry access uses PSDrive prefixes: `HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\...`, `HKCU:\\...` — NOT raw `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\...`\n   - Environment variables: read with `$env:NAME`, set with `$env:NAME = \"value\"` (NOT `Set-Variable` or bash `export`)\n   - Call native exe with spaces in path via call operator: `& \"C:\\Program Files\\App\\app.exe\" arg1 arg2`\n\nInteractive and blocking commands (will hang — this tool runs with -NonInteractive):\n   - NEVER use `Read-Host`, `Get-Credential`, `Out-GridView`, `$Host.UI.PromptForChoice`, or `pause`\n   - Destructive cmdlets (`Remove-Item`, `Stop-Process`, `Clear-Content`, etc.) may prompt for confirmation. Add `-Confirm:$false` when you intend the action to proceed. Use `-Force` for read-only/hidden items.\n   - Never use `git rebase -i`, `git add -i`, or other commands that open an interactive editor\n\nPassing multiline strings (commit messages, file content) to native executables:\n   - Use a single-quoted here-string so PowerShell does not expand `$` or backticks inside. The closing `'@` MUST be at column 0 (no leading whitespace) on its own line — indenting it is a parse error:\n<example>\ngit commit -m @'\nCommit message here.\nSecond line with $literal dollar signs.\n'@\n</example>\n   - Use `@'...'@` (single-quoted, literal) not `@\"...\"@` (double-quoted, interpolated) unless you need variable expansion\n   - For arguments containing `-`, `@`, or other characters PowerShell parses as operators, use the stop-parsing token: `git log --% --format=%H`\n\nUsage notes:\n  - The command argument is required.\n  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to " +
		windowshell.NumberString(windowshell.MaxTimeout(env)) +
		"ms / " +
		windowshell.NumberString(windowshell.MaxTimeout(env)/60000) +

		windowshell.NumberString(windowshell.DefaultTimeout(env)) +
		"ms (" +
		windowshell.NumberString(windowshell.DefaultTimeout(env)/60000) +
		" minutes).\n  - It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does.\n  - If the output exceeds " +
		windowshell.NumberString(float64(windowshell.OutputLimit(env))) +
		" characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.\n" +
		background +
		"  - Avoid using PowerShell to run commands that have dedicated tools, unless explicitly instructed:\n    - File search: Use " +
		"Glob" +
		" (NOT Get-ChildItem -Recurse)\n    - Content search: Use " +
		"Grep" +
		" (NOT Select-String)\n    - Read files: Use " +

		"Edit" +

		"Write" +
		" (NOT Set-Content/Out-File)\n    - Communication: Output text directly (NOT Write-Output/Write-Host)\n  - When issuing multiple commands:\n    - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple " +
		"PowerShell" +
		" tool calls in a single message.\n    - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, chain them in a single " +
		"PowerShell" +
		" call (see edition-specific chaining syntax above).\n    - Use `;` only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail.\n    - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings and here-strings)\n  - Do NOT prefix commands with `cd` or `Set-Location` -- the working directory is already set to the correct project directory automatically.\n" +
		sleep +
		"  - For git commands:\n    - Prefer to create a new commit rather than amending an existing commit.\n    - Before running destructive operations (e.g., git reset --hard, git push --force, git checkout --), consider whether there is a safer alternative that achieves the same goal. Only use destructive operations when they are truly the best approach.\n    - Never skip hooks (--no-verify) or bypass signing (--no-gpg-sign, -c commit.gpgsign=false) unless the user has explicitly asked for it. If a hook fails, investigate and fix the underlying issue."

There is no need to sleep in this case.\n    - Do not retry failing commands in a sleep loop — diagnose the root cause or consider an alternative approach.\n    - If waiting for a background task you started with `run_in_background`, you will be notified when it completes — do not poll.\n    - If you must poll an external process, use a check command rather than sleeping first.\n    - If you must sleep, keep the duration short (1-5 seconds) to avoid blocking the user."

const powerShellDesktopEdition = "PowerShell edition: Windows PowerShell 5.1 (powershell.exe)\n   - Pipeline chain operators `&&` and `||` are NOT available — they cause a parser error.

Use `if/else` and explicit `$null -eq` checks instead.\n   - Avoid `2>&1` on native executables. In 5.1, redirecting a native command's stderr inside PowerShell wraps each line in an ErrorRecord (NativeCommandError) and sets `$?` to `$false` even when the exe returned exit code 0. stderr is already captured for you — don't redirect it.\n   - Default file encoding is UTF-16 LE (with BOM). When writing files other tools will read, pass `-Encoding utf8` to `Out-File`/`Set-Content`.\n   - `ConvertFrom-Json` returns a PSCustomObject, not a hashtable. `-AsHashtable` is not available."

const powerShellCoreEdition = "PowerShell edition: PowerShell 7+ (pwsh)\n   - Pipeline chain operators `&&` and `||` ARE available and work like bash. Prefer `cmd1 && cmd2` over `cmd1; cmd2` when cmd2 should only run if cmd1 succeeds.\n   - Ternary (`$cond ? $a : $b`), null-coalescing (`??`), and null-conditional (`?.`) operators are available.\n   - Default file encoding is UTF-8 without BOM."

const powerShellUnknownEdition = "PowerShell edition: unknown — assume Windows PowerShell 5.1 for compatibility\n   - Do NOT use `&&`, `||`, ternary `?:`, null-coalescing `??`, or null-conditional `?.`. These are PowerShell 7+ only and parser-error on 5.1.\n   - To chain commands conditionally: `A; if ($?) { B }`. Unconditionally: `A; B`."
